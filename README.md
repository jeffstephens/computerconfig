## My GeekTool Scripts
These are *extremely* simple scripts used to display information on my desktop.
I use the excellent [http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/](GeekTool) to place the
scripts' output on my desktop.

See `example-desktop.png` for an example of how my desktop looks, though I don't love it
by any means.
